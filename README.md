Needed Fixes/attention:

Styling adjustment for "alert-success" - When using this site on my iPhone 5 I have to scroll down to see the forecast. I get a tiny glimpse of the bootstarp "alert-success" at the bottom of the screen. However, a friend using the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge said it looked fine and seemed normal. He sent me a screenshot, and it looked how I would want it to on my iPhone.

Add option to change between degrees celcius and fahrenheit.
